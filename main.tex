\section{Introduction}
As an eleven-grade student of Nazarbayev Intellectual school of Physics and Mathematics in Astana (here and after 11 grader) I had noticed that I am exhausted after the school and cannot perform as productive as during the school day. After brief discussion with my peers, we all agreed that we feel tired in the beginning of the school day and in the evenings. 11 graders’ lessons start at 8AM and finish at 4 PM. After brief research in the YouTube platform, I have found a video called "Is your school slowly destroying your brain?" \cite{youtube} based on a "Why we sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams" \cite{Walker2017}, which states that adolescents naturally go to bed later and get up later than adults. Despite the later start time comparing with American students, 11 graders still need to get up early in order to commute to school using public or private means of transportation, unlike students from the United States of America with famous school buses. Which means that debate about effects of the timetable on their productivity is open.

Considering scientific lens, one research states that in the early morning, productivity of school students is at its maximum, and falls during the day \cite[p. 10]{Pope2016}. Which means that early start of the classes at NIS PhM is beneficial for students, as they spend more time learning while they have higher level of productivity. Which is crucial to achieve satisfying academical performance.

On the other hand, group of researchers state that students during classes, which start early performing worse. In addition to that, they have lower productivity during subsequent classes, than their peers without classes, which start early in the morning \cite{Carell2018}. Authors also provide causes of these results, namely, circadian rhythms of adolescents which are switched a bit later than the school starts (p. 18).  This means, that NIS PhM in Astana students have lower productivity during school day, which may lead to academical problems.

The importance of the research on this topic cannot be undermined, as students’ productivity affects their results and academical outcome. It is especially important to get quality education for NIS students, as they get enormous grants, in comparison with municipal schools’ students, from the republican funding \cite{Massimov_res, zakon_2020}.

The purpose of the research is to access effects of the schedule of 11 graders in NIS PhM in Nur-Sultan on their productivity and performance. 

I claim that the schedule of 11 graders in NIS PhM in Nur-Sultan is negatively affecting their productivity during school day, due to sleep schedule disruptions and distortion of circadian rhythms.

\newpage
\section{Aims}

High school is an important part of a person’s life, as it is time, when people prepare for a university and any other future path. Which is why it is crucial to stay productive in order to get high quality education and preparation. However, there is no research, evaluating effects of NIS schedule on 11 graders.

The goal of this research is to evaluate effects of school’s start time, end time and on 11 graders, and their productivity’s dependency on time considering biological development of adolescents.

As the research goes, I will try to answer these questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How does school start time affect 11 graders’ productivity?
    \item How do circadian rhythms affect 11 graders’ productivity?
    \item How do 11 graders’ productivity depend on time?
\end{itemize}

In order to answer aforementioned questions, I will analyze secondary sources, namely research conducted on this topic. They will help me to gain experience from other countries and create basis for a scientific, especially biological, lens. Also, I will conduct and interview with an unbiased 11 grader, who can tell more about their thoughts on the timetable.

Different aspects of the school timetable are likely to differently affect students’ productivity. There may be advantages and disadvantages for an early start time and long duration of the school day, I do not expect anything about the first yet, however I am expecting more negative sides of prolonging school days.

\section {Context}

The first thing important to look for is evidence of better health and lower sleepiness with later start of school day. There is a study on this matter called “Impact of Delaying School Start Time on Adolescent Sleep, Mood, and Behavior” \cite{Owens2010}. It was looking into effects of 30 minutes delay of an independent school start time from 8 AM to 8:30 AM (p.2) via 2 surveys of students before the intervention and after. The results of their research have shown, that mean amount of sleep students get during nights after the school increased from 7-7.9 to 8-8.9 (p.4). Also, lower number of students reported sleepiness related behavior, but still most of participants were struggling to do homework due to weariness and to get up early and stay awake (Figure 1) (p. 5). As one can see, delay of 30 minutes reduces all of problems, however some of them still are high enough. Ergo, later start of the school benefits health of 11 graders.

Moreover, there is evidence, that 9 in the morning is still early to start the school. Another research “Is 8:30 a.m. still too early to start school? A 10:00 a.m. school start time improves health and performance of students aged 13-16” \cite{Kelley2017} conducted a three-year experiment, where they started observation from the year 0 with start time at 8:30 a.m. and then 2 years with start time at 10 a.m. and then in year three they returned to start time at 8:30 a.m. Results have shown, that intervention to the schedule led to lower rates of absences due illness and better academic achievements. After getting back to the original school start time, improvements have been kept. This research can be used because there was no significant difference among different ages in the research 30 minutes delay to 8:30 a.m. \cite{Owens2010}, hence it can be concluded that school schedule still has negative impact on productivity and health of 11 graders.

There is particular research on sleep distortion and its connection to productivity, called “Being physically active increases yet sedentary bouts and lack of sleep decrease work ability” \cite{Giurgiu2021}. Researchers used 3 accelerometers on each person as a complex system which collects data of all kinds of movements (p. 2-3). Results mainly were analyzed on sedentary behavior; however, sleep patterns were analyzed too. Deviation from normal amount of sleep (approximately) resulted in worse productivity (p.7). Which means early start of the school slightly decreases productivity of 11 graders.

One of the proposed reasons of productivity drivers is that circadian rhythms affect mind of people and their distortion \cite{Carell2018}. That is why it is necessary to find evidence that adolescents have delay in daily circadian cycle. A team of scientist made research on this particular topic, called “Sleep, circadian rhythms, and delayed phase in adolescence” \cite{CROWLEY2007602}. It is based on surveys of students 11 to 19 years old, finding a significant gap between bedtime and risetime on weekday and weekends (p.2). Results have shown, that delayed circadian phase in adolescents is due to both external and internal (biological and homeostatic) factors (p.8). Using their research in can be shown, that first lesson of 11 graders is during the time, when they are usually asleep during weekends.

As the mornings in winter are darker than in the summer, and the school start time doesn’t change in the winter, leading to the darker classrooms during first two lessons, and  light and dark affect circadian rhythms also circadian rhythms affect sleep \cite{nigms}, it is important to search for evidence of light changes disrupting sleep and school performance. There is a research, conducting experiment on circadian light exposure, called “Measuring circadian light and its impact on adolescents” \cite{Figueiro2011}. They used orange glasses to block the circadian light from one group of students. They and the control group studied in same conditions for one week wearing daysimeters to find changes between daylight exposure and circadian timing. As a result, it was concluded that lower daylight exposure leads to later circadian timing. Despite this fact connections between scholastic performance and daylight exposure were inconclusive and have shown low correlation (p.12). This means, that the distortion of circadian rhythms is not the reason of changes in performance and attendance levels in research and 11 graders’ productivity is not affected by circadian rhythms \cite{Kelley2017, Owens2010}. However, this doesn’t change the fact that they are studying during low circadian phase, as shown in previous paragraph.

\section{Method}
The research design contains secondary research and will contain primary research. The first is needed to obtain background information and identify the situation concerning research questions. The second will be made to gather qualitive data about the situation of 11 graders via interview.

The background information was collected via Internet libraries because library in the NIS PhM in Astana and other local libraries did not provide current information on the research topic and didn’t have printed volumes of journals. I used Google Scholar and ProQuest online databases as they mostly contain credible sources, namely works of researchers such as books and journal articles. To be sure in their credibility, I checked authors, places of publication and their bias.

The primary research method will be is an interview with an average female 11 grader. I decided to choose her to get more data with a personal opinion, which could open the way for more research on this topic across the country. To do the interview I will use audio recorder in order to store the interview and I will personally transcribe the interview. The whole transcription will be attached to the appendices of the paper.

One more crucial thing to do is data triangulation, which will help to increase the validity and credibility of my sources. In particular, it will help me to benefit results of the future interview and survey with my secondary sources. Generally, it will increase credibility of my research paper with results closer to the reality and reliability of my research paper.

\section{Results and conclusion}

The interviewee was definite in her answers. She is an early riser, but due to amount of homework, she has sleep deprivation (only 6 hours of sleep on weekdays). Which is extremely harmful, as found in researches (2003) \cite{Giurgiu2021,dongen2003} Due to formed routine, it was hard for her to switch to a normal schedule with start of lessons at 8 AM, also it led to less sleep due to longer school days. And introduced large number of 20-minute brakes interrupts her productivity. But most importantly, she self-reported that she had better productivity, when school started at 9 AM, which corresponds with current scientific consensus, made on research \cite{Kelley201,Owens2010}. Also, her self-reported productivity does not correlate with circadian rhythms \cite{Figueiro2011}. Unexpectedly interviewee prefers to learn at home rather than in school, as it is more producitve and comprehensive this way.

\textit{How does school start time affect 11 graders’ productivity?}

Both primary and secondary \cite{Kelley2017, Owens2010} research have shown, that later start time of the school is beneficial. As start time is one of the essential parts of the schedule, these conclusions should not be ignored.

\textit{How do circadian rhythms affect 11 graders’ productivity?}

Both primary and secondary \cite{Figueiro2011} research have shown that productivity circadian rhythm cannot be considered as a productivity driver. Thus, schedule managers should not consult with biologists.

\textit{How do 11 graders’ productivity depend on time?}

This is only slightly covered question. Primary research has shown that there is time dependence of productivity due to fatigue. However direct connection wasn’t found. Importance of this topic cannot be denied as schedule is a way to organize time.

\section{Limitations}
The hardest limitation of my research was the time limit. Due to inability to do research for 3 weeks straight, I had to quickly do the primary research, which may have affected its quality. However, I did my best to conduct beneficial interview and qualitatively analyze it. Also because of that, I had to give up on idea of conducting a survey, which would be highly beneficial, considering my research questions. Instead, I used interview, which was the second-best option for my research.
	
Due to small amount of time, I could not find the room for an interview during weekends, which is why I held it via audiochat. There were some background noises on either side, so I had to manually transcribe the audio recording. Also, due to different language of the interview I had to translate it to make it understandable for the main auditory. Unfortunately, meaning or tone of some phrases could be lost due to translation. However, I did my best doing that, so almost all of the mood of the interview is not lost. 

I interviewed only one person, so making conclusions basing only on her answer is quite dangerous, because it is uncheckable that her answer is not an outlier. However, I used general questions, because they offer ability to know her opinion on other people, because some of it is leaked or told during the brake.
	
Moreover, online libraries lacked big number of free qualitative and quantitative researches on the topic, which led me to using the limited secondary sources. This could mean that this topic is not satisfyingly comprehended by secondary research.

\section{Evaluation}
Overall, the research was quite productive, and has enough evidence to raise a concern about efficiency and safety of the current timetable at NIS PhM in Astana. As far as I am concerned, each section of the research has been conducted properly, however, due to my lack of expertise, and experience, and other aforementioned limitations, there are still some things that can be improved.	

The secondary research was conducted with persistence but due to limited amount of free literature it could be incomprehensive. However, all of the found were thoroughly analyzed and all of the related parts were used to their maximum. All of three research questions were comprehended and discussed in the secondary research. The secondary research can be improved with more time on it and usage of other online libraries; however it would have much effect as all of the aforementioned papers were almost everything that Google Scholars database and search engine could find on the topic.

The main interview was conducted poorly due to lack of time. This led to its longer duration. However, all of the 3 research questions were fully covered in the course of it. Also, during the thematic analysis gaps were found, that is why follow-up interview had to be conducted. Second interview was conducted better due to more experience and greater confidence in myself and in my interviewee, as the procedure was quite familiar, and was conducted in real life, instead of online call. After that interview was comprehensive enough to finish the thematic analysis. The interview could be improved with a more thorough analysis and conducting focus-group interview. Generally, primary research can be improved with the survey and interview with expert basing on secondary sources and survey.

The research was quite affective on my perspective on the topic. In the beginning I thought that a) sleep deficiency is harmful for adolescents; b) earlier start of the school is effective c) students productivity depends on circadian rhythms, therefore it is time dependent. After the research I have come to the conclusion, that perspective a) was correct, b) was incorrect c) was partially incorrect, as productivity doesn’t depend on circadian rhythms, however, is directly depend on weariness of a student. Also unpredicted themes were raised, such as difference between covering the program at home and at school, efficiency of lessons, resting at school. This means, that there are still branches to be researched.

\newpage
\section{Further research}

The outcome of the research suggests a further area to study.
	
Firstly, the efficiency of school program should be evaluated. Some topics could be covered too broadly and others too shortly. In the 11th grade students are quite capable of learning school material at home, as interview has shown. Along with it, efficiency of lessons should be judged and analyzed. Probably there are better ways to conduct lessons. Qualitative research with a quite broad focus group could prove efficient as it allows to collect reactions and response of students.
	
Secondly, the efficiency of school schedule was evaluated considering 11 graders. Meaning, that timetable of other grades and their response should be evaluated and the teachers’ response to the timetable should be evaluated, as they are too, very important part of the studying process. For this purposes, quantitative research could prove efficient as results can be used in planning the schedule and timetable.
